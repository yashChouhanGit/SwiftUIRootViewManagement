# SwiftUIRootViewManagement
SwiftUIAppEntryApp is a SwiftUI iOS template with dynamic root view management via a centralized AppEntryViewModel. Switch seamlessly between independent root views (Splash, Home, Login, etc.), each with its own navigation stack. This architecture simplifies navigation, ensures modularity, and is ideal for scalable, state-driven apps.
